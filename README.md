# ApprentiDash v2 - Team Queue 

ApprentiDash is a tool to clock OJT hours and a hub to connect with other Apprentices. 

If none of the above applies, you can also use ApprentiDash for any general timesheet needs. 

This project was built on top of the original [Apprentice Dashboard](https://github.com/team-boolean/apprenti-dash).



If you want to try it out for youself, you can find the live deployment [here](http://finalprojectapprentidashboard-env.4gepw3ap4a.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com).

#### Notifications

Do you want to know if an account was created using your email address? Do you like to get notifications on your 
phone to confirm that you are done for the day? This app supports both cases with email and text notifications. 

#### Apprenti Forum

Get answers to questions only Apprentices would understand. Or, you know, share a Dad joke or two. 
 
The ApprentiDash forum has full functionality to create a new discussion and comment on others' discussions.
